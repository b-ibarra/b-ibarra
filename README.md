# Welcome to my Data Hub 🖖🚀📊✨

### I'm Beatriz Ibarra, bioinformatician and data scientist focused on the analysis and architecture of health data 


#### About me
🇲🇽 I am from Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mx  
🎓 I hold a BSc in Biotechnology Engineering, a MSc in Population Genetics, and a PhD in Bioinformatics.  
🧋 In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting weights, and I consider myself an avid iced coffee taster.

#### About my work
My work centers on designing and implementing pipelines that transform complex, raw data into actionable insights and well-structured information, driving informed decisions in healthcare. Particularly I specialize in:
            🏥 Transforming unstructured clinical records into structured datasets suitable for model training and decision-making.
            📄 Converting diverse data sources including handwritten documents, word files, PDFs, and other formats into analyzable datasets.
            🔧 Designing ETL-based data pipelines with AI API integrations for automated extraction, ensuring efficient processing and quality control.
            📊 Crating interactive dashboards for data visualization, enabling stakeholders to easily interpret complex information.
            🔍 Performing advanced analytics using statistical methods to uncover correlations and generate meaningful insights from healthcare data.
            🧬 Also, I usually work with gut microbiomes and microbial ecosystems to identify significant patterns that explain interactions within them.  

#### About my research
In my PhD research, I explored how glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide globally 🌱, might impact vertebrates by disrupting their gut microbiota equilibrium.  
This investigation is particularly relevant due to the commercial claim that glyphosate is safe for animals, overlooking potential indirect effects stemming from dysbiosis.  
To assess changes in the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in a model organism 🐟, I developed and implemented methodologies, primarily leveraging bioinformatic tools along with statistical analysis and visualization techniques in R.  

Currently, the results of my research are undergoing the publication process. Meanwhile, you can explore a review on this topic that we authored last year, which was awarded 'Paper of the Month' in the Gut Microbiome Journal for June.
