# Hi! Welcome to my Data Science Hub 🖖🚀📊✨

### I am Beatriz Ibarra-Mendoza, Data Scientist transitioning from Biotech career


#### About me
🇲🇽 I am from Mazatlán, México, a place well known as 'La Perla del Pacífico'.  
🧬 I usually work with gut microbiomes and microbial ecosystems to identify significant patterns that explain interactions within them.  
📈 I am deeply passionate about extracting insights from data. I love data!  
👩🏽‍🏫 I am self-taught, and I also enjoy sharing knowledge with others, which is why I have been working as a science professor since 2017.  
🧫 Additionally, I have worked as a chemist analyst, specializing in bromatology, microbiology and quality control.  
🧋 In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting weights, and I consider myself an avid iced coffee taster.

#### About my research
In my PhD research, I explored how glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide globally 🌱, might impact vertebrates by disrupting their gut microbiota equilibrium.  
This investigation is particularly relevant due to the commercial claim that glyphosate is safe for animals, overlooking potential indirect effects stemming from dysbiosis.  
To assess changes in the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in a model organism 🐟, I developed and implemented methodologies, primarily leveraging bioinformatic tools along with statistical analysis and visualization techniques in R.  

Currently, the results of my research are undergoing the publication process. Meanwhile, you can explore a review on this topic that we authored last year, which was awarded 'Paper of the Month' in the Gut Microbiome Journal for June.

#### Unexpected [and gratifying] turns 
Since completing my B.Sc., I have been immersed in the world of genomic databases, where I focused on identifying genes or mutations associated with specific pathologies 🔬. These initial steps into bioinformatics opened my perspective to the amount of data waiting to be explored and processed for invaluable insights. My affinity for data analysis consolidated during my Ph.D., where I delved into coding with R and exploring new programming languages. However, my journey did not stop there 👩🏽‍💻. Feeling compelled to expand my skill set further, I recently completed a certification in Data Science and AI, which proved to be a challenging and rewarding experience. This certification introduced me to a whole new world of areas to explore, particularly delving into Python programming 🐍. Yet, my pursuit of knowledge does not end here, it is a lifelong journey that I am commited to 🎯🚀.
