# Hi! Welcome to my Data Science Hub 🖖🚀📊✨

### I am Beatriz Ibarra-Mendoza, Data Scientist transitioning from Biotech career


#### About me
🇲🇽 I am from Mazatlán, México, a place well known as 'La Perla del Pacífico'.  
🧬 I usually work with gut microbiomes and microbial ecosystems to identify significant patterns that explain interactions within them.  
📈 I am deeply passionate about extracting insights from data. I love data!  
👩🏽‍🏫 I am self-taught, and I also enjoy sharing knowledge with others, which is why I have been working as a science professor since 2017.  
🧫 Additionally, I have worked as a chemist analyst, specializing in bromatology, microbiology and quality control.  
🧋 In my free time, I enjoy reading, lifting weights, and I consider myself an avid iced coffee taster.

#### About my research
In my PhD research, I explored how glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide globally 🌱, might impact vertebrates by disrupting their gut microbiota equilibrium.  
This investigation is particularly relevant due to the commercial claim that glyphosate is safe for animals, overlooking potential indirect effects stemming from dysbiosis.  
To assess changes in the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in a model organism 🐟, I developed and implemented methodologies, primarily leveraging bioinformatic tools along with statistical analysis and visualization techniques in R.  

Currently, the results of my research are undergoing the publication process. Meanwhile, you can explore a review on this topic that we authored last year, which was awarded 'Paper of the Month' in the Gut Microbiome Journal for June.
